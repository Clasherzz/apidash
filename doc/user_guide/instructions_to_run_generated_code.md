## C# (HttpClient)

Here are the detailed instructions for running the generated API Dash code in C# (using `HttpClient`) for macOS, Windows, and Linux:

### 1. Setting Up the C# Development Environment
#### macOS and Windows:
1. **Install .NET SDK:**
   - Visit the [official .NET download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
   - Download and install the latest .NET SDK for macOS.
2. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open the terminal and run the following command to verify the installation:
     ```bash
     dotnet --version
     ```

#### Linux:
1. **Install .NET SDK:**
   - Run the following commands based on your distribution:
     - For Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:
       ```bash
       sudo apt update
       sudo apt install dotnet-sdk-7.0
       ```
     - For Fedora/CentOS-based systems:
       ```bash
       sudo dnf install dotnet-sdk-7.0
       ```
2. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open the terminal and run the following command to verify the installation:
     ```bash
     dotnet --version
     ```

### 2. Preparing a Project

#### In Visual Studio:
1. **Create a New Project:**
   - Open Visual Studio and select **Create a new project**.
   - Choose the **Console Application (.NET Core)** template and create the project.

2. **Check `System.Net.Http` Namespace:**
   - `HttpClient` is included by default. No additional installation is required.

#### Using the CLI:
1. **Create a Project:**
   ```bash
   dotnet new console -n HttpClientExample
   cd HttpClientExample
   ```

2. **Install the Package (if necessary):**
   ```bash
   dotnet add package System.Net.Http
   ```

### 3. Execute the generated code:
Once you have .NET(C#) and `HttpClient` installed, follow these steps to execute the generated code:

1. **Open a IDE/text editor** ‚úçÔ∏è (Visual Studio, VS Code or any other text editor).
2. **Copy the generated code** üìã from API Dash.
3. **Paste the code** into your project. ex) prgoram.cs

#### In Visual Studio:
1. Click the **Start Debugging (F5)** button from the top menu to run the project.
2. The output window will display the API response.

#### Using the CLI:
1. Open the terminal at the project root directory and run the following command:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

#### **Using a Text Editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code):**
1. Open a text editor or an IDE like Visual Studio Code.
2. Create a new Dart file, such as `api_test.dart`.
3. Copy the generated code from API Dash and paste it into this file.
4. Save the file.
5. Run the Dart file using the terminal or the IDE's built-in tools.

#### **Using the Command Line:**
1. Save the generated code to a Dart file, e.g., `api_test.dart`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file.
3. Run the Dart file with the following command:  
   ```bash
   dart run api_test.dart
   ```

## Dart (dio)

Here are the detailed instructions for running the generated API Dash code in **Dart (using `dio`)** for macOS, Windows, and Linux:

### **1. Install Dart**

- Visit the official **[Dart Installation Guide](https://dart.dev/get-dart)** for step-by-step installation instructions for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

### **2. Add the `dio` Package**

- Add the `dio` package as a dependency under the `dependencies` section of the `pubspec.yaml` file:  
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     dio: ^5.7.0
   ```  
- Run the following command to fetch the dependency:  
   ```bash
   dart pub get
   ```

### **3. Run the Generated Code**  

#### **Using a Text Editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code):**
1. Open a text editor or an IDE like Visual Studio Code.
2. Create a new Dart file, such as `api_test.dart`.
3. Copy the generated code from API Dash and paste it into this file.
4. Save the file.
5. Run the Dart file using the terminal or the IDE's built-in tools.

#### **Using the Command Line:**
1. Save the generated code to a Dart file, e.g., `api_test.dart`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file.
3. Run the Dart file with the following command:  
   ```bash
   dart run api_test.dart
   ```

## Python (requests)

Here are the detailed instructions for running the generated API Dash code in Python (using `requests`) for macOS, Windows, and Linux:

### 1. Install Python:
#### macOS:
- Go to the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/)
- Download the latest version for macOS and follow the installation instructions.

#### Windows:
- Go to the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Download the latest version for Windows and run the installer. During installation, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH."

#### Linux:
- Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. To check if Python is already installed, open the terminal and type:

```bash
python3 --version
```

- If it's not installed, you can install it via your package manager:
  - On Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3
    ```

  - On Fedora/CentOS-based systems:

    ```bash
    sudo dnf install python3
    ```

### 2. Install the `requests` library:
#### macOS and Linux:
Open the terminal and type the following command to install the `requests` library using `pip`:

```bash
pip3 install requests
```

#### Windows:
Open Command Prompt (or PowerShell) and type the following command to install the `requests` library using `pip`:

```bash
pip install requests
```

### 3. Execute the generated code:
Once you have Python and `requests` installed, follow these steps to execute the generated code:

1. **Open a text editor** ‚úçÔ∏è (like Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on macOS, or any code editor like Visual Studio Code).
2. **Copy the generated code** üìã from API Dash.
3. **Paste the code** into the text editor üîÑ.
4. **Save the file** üíæ with a `.py` extension, such as `api_test.py`.

This makes the steps a little more visual and fun!

#### macOS and Linux:
1. Open the **Terminal**.
2. **Navigate to the directory** where you saved the `.py` file. For example:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/file
```

3. **Run the Python script** by typing the following command:

```bash
python3 api_test.py
```

#### Windows:
1. Open **Command Prompt** (or PowerShell).
2. **Navigate to the directory** where you saved the `.py` file. For example:

```bash
cd C:\path\to\your\file
```

3. **Run the Python script** by typing the following command:

```bash
python api_test.py
```

## Python (http.client)

Here are the detailed instructions for running the generated API Dash code in Python using `http.client`:

### 1. Install Python:
Check out the instructions [here](#1-install-python) for detailed steps on how to install Python on macOS, Windows, or Linux.

### 2. `http.client` is a built-in library:
Unlike other Python libraries (like `requests`), `http.client` is part of Python's standard library. You can directly use it without any additional installation steps.

### 3. Execute the generated code:
Check out the instructions [here](#3-execute-the-generated-code) for detailed steps on how to run the code.
